feat: Enhance Dashboard UI, Access Control, and SOP Management Logic

Major enhancements to the Proposer Dashboard, Access Control restrictions, and core SOP management logic.

1. Dashboard Redesign (Pengusul):

   - Redesigned `SopPengusulStats` and `SopStatsOverview` widgets with sparkline trend charts and distinct colors/icons for a premium look.
   
   - Optimized widget layout: Removed duplicate stats (Total, Under Review, etc.) from the overview widget, ensuring only unique alerts (Annual Review, Expiration) are shown.
   
   - Removed `FilamentInfoWidget` from the panel footer.

2. Access Control & Security:

   - Implemented strict edit restrictions for 'AKTIF' and 'DALAM REVIEW' SOPs.
   
   - Added `mount()` protection in `EditDokumenSop` to redirect unauthorized edit attempts.
   
   - Disabled table row clicks in `DokumenSopResource` for locked statuses.

3. SOP Management Logic:

   - Relaxed SK Number uniqueness: Dropped database unique index and updated validation to allow duplicate SK numbers only for 'DRAFT' status.
   
   - Enhanced Direksi Visibility: Updated query scope to allow Directors to view SOPs owned by their units AND relevant 'SOP_AP' (cross-unit) documents.

4. Deletion & Recovery System:

   - Separated Soft Delete (Trash) and Force Delete functionalities.
   
   - Created `SopSampahResource` in SuperAdmin panel for managing deleted SOPs.
   
   - Fixed history logging for Delete/Restore actions and resolved `Storage` facade import errors.

5. Infrastructure & Seeding:

   - Added `sessions` table migration to resolve missing table errors.
   
   - Created `SopTestingSeeder` to generate realistic dataset with specific date scenarios (Approaching Review/Expiration).
